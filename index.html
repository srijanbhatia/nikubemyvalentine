You are, and have always been, the love I never knew to ask for but the one my heart always recognized. In you, I have found a home‚Äîone not made of walls or places, but of laughter, of teasing glances, of hands that fit so perfectly with mine, and of a love that feels both boundless and certain.

You are my greatest surprise, my deepest comfort, and the most beautiful thing my life has ever known. With you, love is not just a word or a grand gesture‚Äîit is in the way you look at me when you think I‚Äôm not watching, in the way you hold me like I am something precious, in the way you make even the smallest moments feel like they are meant to be cherished.

I love you in the quiet and in the storm, in the light and in the dark, in the past, in the present, and in every tomorrow that awaits us. And if there is a world beyond this one, I will find you there too. I will always choose you.

Forever yours,
NS`);
